# Year of Marriage prediction App

In this project we are predicting the year of Marriage of a person.

Firstly we did the EDA on the dataset and then Normalization and using the Labelencoder, we used the `RandomForestRegressor` to predict the year to Marriage.

And After that we export that trained model and load it into the `Flask` App and do prediction.

## To See UI
run a following command in command prompt
```
python app.py
```
## Deployment
Prepare your dataset:
```
1. Data Extraction
2. Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Building and Tuning
5. Building Flask API
6. Pushing code to Github
```
